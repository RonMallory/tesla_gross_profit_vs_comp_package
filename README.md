# Tesla Gross Profit Analysis

Welcome to the most eye-opening analysis of Tesla's financials you'll ever find on the internet. This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that charts Tesla's gross profit from 2011 through 2023. Why, you ask? Well, we decided to compare these figures to something utterly absurd — Elon Musk's compensation package, which is a modest $56 billion.

## What's Inside?

- **TeslaGrossProfitAnalysis.ipynb**: A notebook containing all the serious number-crunching and beautiful plot-drawing to showcase Tesla's financial journey. Watch as the company's gross profit soars over the years... and yet still pales in comparison to the compensation request of its beloved CEO.

## Analysis Overview

We charted Tesla's annual gross profits against a flat line representing a $56 billion compensation package for Elon Musk. Yes, you read that right — $56 billion. Why settle for millions when you can have billions, right?

The graph serves as a stark reminder of just how grounded in reality executive compensation packages are. It's especially heartwarming to see that even in Tesla's best year, the gross profit is just a fraction of Musk's potential payday.

## Sarcastic Disclaimer

This analysis is provided with a heavy dose of sarcasm. Any resemblance to rational financial planning or executive compensation best practices is purely coincidental, and should not be taken as investment advice.

1. Clone this repo.
